Program will not run Python 3 with Windows.


------------------------------------MAKEFILE NOTES-----------------------------------
----REQUIREMENTS--------------------------
    f2py (should come with numpy)
    FORTRAN compiler (From MinGW)
    make (MSYS from MinGW)
    MinGW
------------------------------------------
----MAKEFILE INSTRUCTIONS-----------------
Before the program can be run the FORTRAN modules on the fortran_scripts directory
must be compiled. A makefile has been included in the directory to compile all of the
.f90 files contained in the directory into one file.

1). Make sure that before running the Makefile lines 1,11-13 are uncommented and
    all other lines are commented.
    As will be mentioned later this program is only compatible with Python 2.x on
    Windows due to the need tocompile the .f90 files with f2py. If it is necessary
    to run on Python 3.x a second program adapted singularly with Python code,
    kk-interface-python.

2). Enter the command, make, into the CMD.

Additional Notes:
Must be done from the CMD.

If Python**\ and Python**\Scripts\ are not in PATH make sure to replace line 13 with
the following,

python.exe ***\Python**\Scripts\f2py.py -c $(FLAGS) -m $@ $^

Where the '***' and '**' indicate extra directories and different versions 
respectively. The line above should have a tab before the start of the line to align
with the rules of make.

----MinGW installation--------------------
If gfortran is not installed please do so using MinGW for which the download
is the .exe file in the following link,

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/>

and then proceed to go through the installation installing the following
packages when it becomes available,

---MinGW package list------------
Package                 | Class |
---------------------------------
mingw-developer-toolkit | bin   |
mingw32-base            | bin   |
mingw32-gcc-fortran     | bin   |
mingw32-gcc-fortran     | dev   |
mingw32-gcc-fortran     | doc   |
mingw32-gcc-fortran     | man   |
mingw32-gcc-g++         | bin   |
mingw32-gcc-g++         | dev   |
mingw32-gcc             | bin   |
mingw32-gcc             | dev   |
msys-base               | bin   |

Some of these packages may be under 'All packages' tab in the installer so make
sure that they are all selected.

Once that is done please add the bin folder in the MinGW\bin and the ***\msys\***\bin
install directory to PATH. Also, make sure that the .py file extension is in the 
PATHEXT. Make sure that you find the make.exe file in the ***\msys\***\bin directory
where the '***' may indicate other directories that need to be navigated through.

PATH and PATHEXT can be found in the 'View Advanced System Settings' menu on Windows 
under the 'Environment Varibales' button.
